                  be updated to the latest boot images during cluster upgrades, ensuring that new machines
                  always boot with the current cluster version's boot image. When omitted, this means no opinion
                  and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time.
                  The default for each machine manager mode is All for GCP and AWS platforms, and None for all
                  other platforms.
