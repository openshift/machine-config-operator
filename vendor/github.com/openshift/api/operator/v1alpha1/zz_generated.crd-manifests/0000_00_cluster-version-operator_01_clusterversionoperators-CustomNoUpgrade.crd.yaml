              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                  operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a
                  simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves.

                  Valid values are: "Normal", "Debug", "Trace", "TraceAll".
                  Defaults to "Normal".
