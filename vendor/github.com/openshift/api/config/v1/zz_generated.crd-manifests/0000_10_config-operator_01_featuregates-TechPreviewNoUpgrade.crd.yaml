                        renderedMinimumComponentVersions are the component versions that the feature gate list of this status were rendered from.
                        Currently, the only supported component is Kubelet, and setting the MinimumComponentVersion.Component to "Kubelet" will mean
                        feature set was rendered given the minimumKubeletVersion in the nodes.config object was lower than or equal to the given MinimumComponentVersion.Version

                          MinimumComponentVersion is a pair of Component and Version that specifies the required minimum Version of the given Component
