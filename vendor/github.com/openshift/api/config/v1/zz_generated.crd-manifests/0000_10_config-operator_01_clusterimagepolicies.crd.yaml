                  Scopes matching individual images are named Docker references in the fully expanded form, either using a tag or digest. For example, docker.io/library/busybox:latest (not busybox:latest).
                  More general scopes are prefixes of individual-image scopes, and specify a repository (by omitting the tag or digest), a repository
                  namespace, or a registry host (by only specifying the host name and possibly a port number) or a wildcard expression starting with `*.`, for matching all subdomains (not including a port number).
                  Wildcards are only supported for subdomain matching, and may not be used in the middle of the host, i.e.  *.example.com is a valid case, but example*.*.com is not.
                  This support no more than 256 scopes in one object. If multiple scopes match a given image, only the policy requirements for the most specific scope apply. The policy requirements for more general scopes are ignored.
                  In addition to setting a policy appropriate for your own deployed applications, make sure that a policy on the OpenShift image repositories
                  quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release, quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev (or on a more general scope) allows deployment of the OpenShift images required for cluster operation.
                  If a scope is configured in both the ClusterImagePolicy and the ImagePolicy, or if the scope in ImagePolicy is nested under one of the scopes from the ClusterImagePolicy, only the policy from the ClusterImagePolicy will be applied.
