                      custom is a user-defined TLS security profile. Be extremely careful using a custom
                      profile as invalid configurations can be catastrophic. An example custom profile
                      looks like this:

                        minTLSVersion: VersionTLS11
                        ciphers:

                          ciphers is used to specify the cipher algorithms that are negotiated
                          during the TLS handshake. Operators may remove entries that their operands
                          do not support. For example, to use only ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 (yaml):

                            ciphers:
                              - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256

                          TLS 1.3 cipher suites (e.g. TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256) are not configurable
                          and are always enabled when TLS 1.3 is negotiated.

                          minTLSVersion is used to specify the minimal version of the TLS protocol
                          that is negotiated during the TLS handshake. For example, to use TLS
                          versions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (yaml):

                            minTLSVersion: VersionTLS11

                      intermediate is a TLS profile for use when you do not need compatibility with
                      legacy clients and want to remain highly secure while being compatible with
                      most clients currently in use.

                      modern is a TLS security profile for use with clients that support TLS 1.3 and
                      do not need backward compatibility for older clients.

                      This profile is equivalent to a Custom profile specified as:

                      type is one of Old, Intermediate, Modern or Custom. Custom provides the
                      ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters.

                      The profiles are based on version 5.7 of the Mozilla Server Side TLS
                      configuration guidelines. The cipher lists consist of the configuration's
                      "ciphersuites" followed by the Go-specific "ciphers" from the guidelines.
                      See: https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/guidelines/5.7.json

                      The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are
                      developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure. Depending on
                      precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be reduced.
