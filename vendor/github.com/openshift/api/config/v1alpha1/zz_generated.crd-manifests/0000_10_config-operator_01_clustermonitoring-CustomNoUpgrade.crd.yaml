                      Valid values are Disabled and NamespaceIsolated
                      Disabled disables monitoring for user-defined projects. This restricts the default monitoring stack, installed in the openshift-monitoring project, to monitor only platform namespaces, which prevents any custom monitoring configurations or resources from being applied to user-defined namespaces.
                      NamespaceIsolated enables monitoring for user-defined projects with namespace-scoped tenancy. This ensures that metrics, alerts, and monitoring data are isolated at the namespace level.
