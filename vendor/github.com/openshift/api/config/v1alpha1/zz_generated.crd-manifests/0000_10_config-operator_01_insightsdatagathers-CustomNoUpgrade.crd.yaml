                      disabledGatherers is a list of gatherers to be excluded from the gathering. All the gatherers can be disabled by providing "all" value.
                      If all the gatherers are disabled, the Insights operator does not gather any data.
                      The format for the disabledGatherer should be: {gatherer}/{function} where the function is optional.
                      Gatherer consists of a lowercase letters only that may include underscores (_).
                      Function consists of a lowercase letters only that may include underscores (_) and is separated from the gatherer by a forward slash (/).
                      The particular gatherers IDs can be found at https://github.com/openshift/insights-operator/blob/master/docs/gathered-data.md.
                      Run the following command to get the names of last active gatherers:
                      "oc get insightsoperators.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq '.status.gatherStatus.gatherers[].name'"
                      An example of disabling gatherers looks like this: `disabledGatherers: ["clusterconfig/machine_configs", "workloads/workload_info"]`
