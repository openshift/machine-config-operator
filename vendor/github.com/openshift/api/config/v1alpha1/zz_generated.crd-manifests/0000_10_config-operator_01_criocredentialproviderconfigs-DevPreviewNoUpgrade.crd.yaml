          CRIOCredentialProviderConfig holds cluster-wide singleton resource configurations for CRI-O credential provider, the name of this instance is "cluster". CRI-O credential provider is a binary shipped with CRI-O that provides a way to obtain container image pull credentials from external sources.
          For example, it can be used to fetch mirror registry credentials from secrets resources in the cluster within the same namespace the pod will be running in.
          CRIOCredentialProviderConfig configuration specifies the pod image sources registries that should trigger the CRI-O credential provider execution, which will resolve the CRI-O mirror configurations and obtain the necessary credentials for pod creation.
          Note: Configuration changes will only take effect after the kubelet restarts, which is automatically managed by the cluster during rollout.

          The resource is a singleton named "cluster".

          Compatibility level 4: No compatibility is provided, the API can change at any point for any reason. These capabilities should not be used by applications needing long term support.

              matchImages:
                description: |-
                  matchImages is a list of string patterns used to determine whether
                  the CRI-O credential provider should be invoked for a given image. This list is
                  passed to the kubelet CredentialProviderConfig, and if any pattern matches
                  the requested image, CRI-O credential provider will be invoked to obtain credentials for pulling
                  that image or its mirrors.
                  Depending on the platform, the CRI-O credential provider may be installed alongside an existing platform specific provider.
                  Conflicts between the existing platform specific provider image match configuration and this list will be handled by
                  the following precedence rule: credentials from built-in kubelet providers (e.g., ECR, GCR, ACR) take precedence over those
                  from the CRIOCredentialProviderConfig when both match the same image.
                  To avoid uncertainty, it is recommended to avoid configuring your private image patterns to overlap with
                  existing platform specific provider config(e.g., the entries from https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/main/templates/common/aws/files/etc-kubernetes-credential-providers-ecr-credential-provider.yaml).
                  You can check the resource's Status conditions
                  to see if any entries were ignored due to exact matches with known built-in provider patterns.

                  This field is optional, the items of the list must contain between 1 and 50 entries.
                  The list is treated as a set, so duplicate entries are not allowed.

                  For more details, see:
                  https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-credential-provider/
                  https://github.com/cri-o/crio-credential-provider#architecture

                  Each entry in matchImages is a pattern which can optionally contain a port and a path. Each entry must be no longer than 512 characters.
                  Wildcards ('*') are supported for full subdomain labels, such as '*.k8s.io' or 'k8s.*.io',
                  and for top-level domains, such as 'k8s.*' (which matches 'k8s.io' or 'k8s.net').
                  A global wildcard '*' (matching any domain) is not allowed.
                  Wildcards may replace an entire hostname label (e.g., *.example.com), but they cannot appear within a label (e.g., f*oo.example.com) and are not allowed in the port or path.
                  For example, 'example.*.com' is valid, but 'exa*mple.*.com' is not.
                  Each wildcard matches only a single domain label,
                  so '*.io' does **not** match '*.k8s.io'.

                  A match exists between an image and a matchImage when all of the below are true:
                  Both contain the same number of domain parts and each part matches.
                  The URL path of an matchImages must be a prefix of the target image URL path.
                  If the matchImages contains a port, then the port must match in the image as well.

                  Example values of matchImages:
                  - 123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
                  - *.azurecr.io
                  - gcr.io
                  - *.*.registry.io
                  - registry.io:8080/path
                items:
                  description: |-
                    MatchImage is a string pattern used to match container image registry addresses.
                    It must be a valid fully qualified domain name with optional wildcard, port, and path.
                    The maximum length is 512 characters.

                    Wildcards ('*') are supported for full subdomain labels and top-level domains.
                    Each entry can optionally contain a port (e.g., :8080) and a path (e.g., /path).
                    Wildcards are not allowed in the port or path portions.

                    Examples:
                    - "registry.io" - matches exactly registry.io
                    - "*.azurecr.io" - matches any single subdomain of azurecr.io
                    - "registry.io:8080/path" - matches with specific port and path prefix
