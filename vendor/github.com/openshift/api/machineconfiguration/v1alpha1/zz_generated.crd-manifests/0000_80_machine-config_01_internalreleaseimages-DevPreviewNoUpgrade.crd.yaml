                  releases is a list of the release bundles currently owned and managed by the

                  contains at least an Available entry set to "True" and Degraded to "False".
                  Entries must be unique, keyed on the name field.
                  releases must contain at least one entry and must not exceed 32 entries.

                        conditions represent the observations of an internal release image current state. Valid types are:
                        Mounted, Installing, Available, Removing and Degraded.

                        If Mounted is true, that means that a valid ISO has been discovered and mounted on one of the cluster nodes.
                        If Installing is true, that means that a new release bundle is currently being copied on one (or more) cluster nodes, and not yet completed.
                        If Available is true, it means that the release has been previously installed on all the cluster nodes, and it can be used.
                        If Removing is true, it means that a release deletion is in progress on one (or more) cluster nodes, and not yet completed.
                        If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong (possibly on one or more cluster nodes).

                        In general, after installing a new release bundle, it is required to wait for the Conditions "Available" to become "True" (and all
                        the other conditions to be equal to "False") before being able to pull its content.
