# e2e IRI tests

This test package should be used for testing the behaviors of the InternalReleaseImage controller.
Currently it is deployed as part of the Agent Installer for OpenShift-Virt (OVE) - and specifically for the NoRegistryClusterInstall feature.
To run the tests, deploy first a baremetal cluster using the OVE ISO.
