# This is an installation script for skopeo. skopeo is needed by the
# e2e-gcp-op-ocl test suite since it pushes and pulls images around.
#
# Using a build-root image for this is the preferred approach (see:
# https://docs.ci.openshift.org/docs/architecture/ci-operator/#build-root-image)
# since skopeo can be installed via dnf at build-time. However, that process is
# a bit more involved. While it would ultimately pay off, it is not in-scope
# with the bug that is being resolved.
#
# Because of limitations within the builder container image and the context it
# runs in, certain adaptations must be made:
# - The builder image does not run as a privileged user and is denied privilege
# escalation. This means that running dnf install -y skopeo cannot be done.
# - The builder image does not have jq installed. This means we need to use
# Python for any JSON parsing we need to perform instead.
# - Because this runs as a non-privileged user, we cannot run the make install
# step for skopeo. Instead, we need to append /tmp/skopeo/bin to the PATH. This
# is done in the Makefile and only for the go test invocation.
