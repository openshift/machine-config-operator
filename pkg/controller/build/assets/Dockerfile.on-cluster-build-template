# Decode and extract the MachineConfig from the gzipped ConfigMap and move it
# into position. We do this in a separate stage so that we don't have the
# gzipped MachineConfig laying around.

# Pull our extensions image. Not sure yet what / how this should be wired up
# though. Ideally, I'd like to use some Buildah tricks to have the extensions
# directory mounted into the container at build-time so that I don't have to
# copy the RPMs into the container, configure the repo, and do the
# installation. Alternatively, I'd have to start a pod with an HTTP server.
