    # Update iptables rules based on google cloud load balancer VIPS
    #
    # This is needed because the GCP L3 load balancer doesn't actually do DNAT;
    # the destination IP address is still the VIP. Normally, there is an agent that
    # adds the vip to the local routing table, tricking the kernel in to thinking
    # it's a local IP and allowing processes doing an accept(0.0.0.0) to receive
    # the packets. Clever.
    #
    # We don't do that. Instead, we DNAT with conntrack. This is so we don't break
    # existing connections when the vip is removed. This is useful for draining
    # connections - take ourselves out of the vip, but service existing conns.
    #
    # Additionally, clients can write a file to /run/cloud-routes/$IP.down to force
    # a VIP as down. This is useful for graceful shutdown / upgrade.
