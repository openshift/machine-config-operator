# This is a VSphere UPI-specific version of nodeip-configuration, which is
# needed because of the way template precedence works in MCO. Most UPI
# platforms get this from the _base directory because their platform is set
# to None. However, VSphere UPI sets platform to VSphere and determines
# whether it should be IPI or UPI based on whether the API VIPs field is
# populated. Because platform is set to VSphere, we instead get the IPI
# version of nodeip-configuration in the on-prem directory. This is disabled
# for UPI deployments because it relies on the existence of a VIP to help with
# IP selection.
# This all means we don't have a good way to keep the _base version of the
# service unless we put some platform-specific logic in the template processing
# code. Instead, we create this duplicate version of the service that will
# only be enabled for VSphere UPI deployments.
