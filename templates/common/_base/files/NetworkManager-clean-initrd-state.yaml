    # Some deployments require an active network early in the boot process. To
    # achieve this, dracut runs specific NetworkManager modules. This results in
    # NetworkManager keyfiles being generated (either default or from ip kernel
    # arguments) and activated. This activation generates state that makes those
    # profiles to be re-activated by the NetworkManager service later in the
    # boot process. And this has the effect that other profiles deployed by the
    # user for the same set of devices are ignored.

    # Most of the time this is the desired behavior. The exception to this rule
    # is when the user wants to run the boot process with a different network
    # setup than the real root which is usually related to the fact that
    # generating images with customized kernel arguments is a complication in
    # the deployment pipeline.

    # This need has been exacerbated by past NetworkManager bugs that activated
    # the network on boot when it was not really needed. Most notably when ip
    # kernel argument is present, something that the baremetal installer adds by
    # default.

    # The intention here is to remove the state that was generated with the
    # activation of those profiles during dracut execution. Then when
    # NetworkManager service runs, the profiles generated by dracut, along with
    # other profiles configured by the user, are evaluated towards finding the
    # most appropriate profile to connect a device with. As a precaution, clean
    # state only for devices that:
    # - have been activated with a default profile (assume that a non-default
    #   configuration expresses intention by user to run with it permanently)
    # - have a specific configured profile set to auto-connect (if there is no
    #   alternate configured profile for a device it makes no sense to
    #   de-activate anything)
    #
    # Although this can theoretically happen on any deployment type, need has
    # mostly come from IPI bare metal deployments. For the time being, this
    # should be opt-in in any other deploment type.
    #
    # There is an RFE filed against NM that once implemented would make this
    # script unnecessary: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2089707
