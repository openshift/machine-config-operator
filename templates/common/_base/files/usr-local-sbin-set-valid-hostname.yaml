    # On some platforms the hostname may be too long (>63 chars).
    #  - On firstboot the hostname is set in the initramfs before NetworkManager
    #    And it may be truncated at 64 characters (too long)
    #  - On reboot affect nodes use 'localhost'.
    #
    # This script is a simple workaround for hostname woes, including
    #  - NOT a localhost name
    #  - NOT longer than 63 characters. Names will be truncated at the
    #    first dot, and then capped at 63 char (which ever is less).
    #  - Race conditions between truncated hostnames by the dhclient
    #    and NetworkManager.
    #
    # Finally, this script is invoked via:
    #  - /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/90-long-hostnames
    #  - on boot via node-valid-hostname.service
