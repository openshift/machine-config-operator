  [Service]
  # We would use Type=notify so that systemd keeps retrying until we succeed (and makes sure the dependent
  # services start correctly if we succeeded only after a retry). But this service uses a custom ExecStart
  # with the infinite until...do loop that reinvents the whole retrying mechanism. For this reason Type=oneshot
  # and Type=notify do not make difference.
  Type=oneshot
  # Would prefer to do Restart=on-failure instead of this bash retry loop, but
  # the version of systemd we have right now doesn't support it. It should be
  # available in systemd v244 and higher.
