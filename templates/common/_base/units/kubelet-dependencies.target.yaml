  Requires=basic.target network-online.target
  Wants=NetworkManager-wait-online.service crio-wipe.service
  # This dependency was introduced in the very first commit of the MCO:
  # https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/commit/8f910e33fdfd4714dfd2445f769b0bbb566325fb#diff-cff20332eb01f47c1d7d4ad1776817ed58e95f024b6457f71eef568ea4383d1cR6
  # We believe it came from CoreOS Tectonic in order to support kubelet NFS mounts.  In theory
  # this dependency should become dynamic (i.e. kubelet should change to only pull
  # it in as necessary)
  Wants=rpc-statd.service
