<!--
Before reporting an issue, check our backlog of
[open issues](https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/issues)
to see if someone else has already reported it. If so, feel free to add
your scenario, or additional information, to the discussion. Or simply
"subscribe" to it to be notified when it is updated.

If you suspect your issue is a bug, please edit your issue description to
include the BUG REPORT INFORMATION shown below. If you fail to provide this
information within 7 days, we cannot debug your issue and will close it. We
will, however, reopen it if you later provide the information.

If you find a new issue with the project we'd love to hear about it! The most
important aspect of a bug report is that it includes enough information for
us to reproduce it. So, please include as much detail as possible and try
to remove the extra stuff that doesn't really relate to the issue itself.
The easier it is for us to reproduce it, the faster it'll be fixed!

Please don't include any private/sensitive information in your issue!

SECURITY NOTICE:
